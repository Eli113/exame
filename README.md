# ABOUT BECOME BETTER OPEN NETWORK(BON)’S MINERS

## 1.Introduction

A Better Open Network is a new blockchain architecture that aims to achieve a high-performance decentralized trusted network community with new blockchain technology, while leveraging the high degree of decentralization brought about by functionally smart contract execution efficiency. And security, building CoinStore exchange, genius, Chains Studio , smart contract development and other projects, for distributed applications (DAPP) in the financial, social, transaction leasing and other areas of the development and promotion of unlimited possibilities and value.

# 2.Block producer's(BP) nodes campaign

- ·Block producer's node

  Block producer's nodes undertake the task of block production in the BON blockchain.In a blockchain system,Block producer played a vital role in ensuring the normal operation of the system. If you are involved in the BON block producers' team, not only can you get the system's billing rights, but you will also get rich rewards.In the BON system, a total of 23 Blocks producer's nodes take turns to produce blocks. Each producer produces 12 blocks without interruption,The block interval is 0.5 seconds, which means that each producer will continuously produce blocks for 6 seconds.   

- ·BP Nodes campaign

  Block producer's(BP) nodes through competition.After registering as our producer candidate account. Start your node,BON contract will automatically compare node information,then the active node ranked in the top 23 will be elected as a producer.Nodes replacement cycled is 24 hours.In the process of producing blocks, if the node goes offline for various reasons, its producer position will be canceled, which will make subsequent candidate nodes supplement.The current online node and its configuration information can be viewed in the [producer information](https://betteropennetwork.org/tracker/producers/).

- ·Nodes reward scheme

  The producer will receive the record reward for the block each time the block production is completed.The number of BON awarded is determined by the current BON acquisition difficulty factor (n): 1/n BON.The difficulty factor(n) will increase with the amount of BON.

- ·Nodes election condition

  In the BON system,BP not only need to complete the output of the block, but also ensure the smooth running of DAPP on the chain.Based on the current situation, we give the following reference information:

> **·system CentOS >=7.2 Ubuntu >=16.04**

> **·CPU: Intel Xeon E5-2676 v3**

> **·RAM: >= 128 Gb**

> **·Disk：>= 40Tb（SATA or SAS)**

> **·Band width: >= 5 Gbps**

> **Nodes need public IP, and you can choose cloud computing services such as AWS.**

> **In addition to meeting the hardware configuration, the producer node holder needs to understand the basic knowledge of the basic Linux system, and have a basic understanding of command line operations and network configuration.**
